Some information that identifies you as an individual (“Personal Information”) is gathered when you register with our Web Site (“Site”), or participate in community activities, focus groups and interviews, contests and promotions (including incentive programs). We also collect Personal Information about you to the extent that you provide it to us online (e.g., by filling out forms on the Site or by submitting such information in an e-mail message) and offline (e.g., by filling out a comment card at one of our locations, or by registering for information concerning community amenities). You provide your Personal Information voluntarily.

Personal Information requested may include your name, your street mailing address, your e-mail address, your telephone number and other information, including information about your personal or business demographics and your home purchasing preferences; however, this information will never include your social security number. In addition, we may ask you to enter an ID, password or similar data when you access this Site, so we can verify your right to access certain portions of the Site. We might also obtain Personal Information about you provided to us by your friends, including your name and e-mail address, as this Site may allow visitors to the Site to send information about our community to others via e-mail. If you choose to tell a friend about our community, we may ask you for your friend’s name and e-mail address. We endeavor to send to your friend such e-mails. We may elect not to send the e-mail in certain circumstances in our discretion (e.g., if the e-mail contains inappropriate or inaccurate information or content). We store your friends’ Personal Information for the purposes of sending these e-mails, tracking the success of our referral program and promoting our community. Your friend may contact us at [info@lakewoodranch.com](mailto:info@lakewoodranch.com) to request that we remove your friend’s Personal Information from our database.

**Statement About Emails that we send and “phishing:”**

We may send you emails from time to time to provide you with useful information regarding our products and services, including special, limited-time offers and discounts. If you receive an email requesting your user ID, your password, your social security number, or your credit card and/or bank information, PLEASE DO NOT RESPOND BY PROVIDING THE INFORMATION REQUESTED. If you receive an email requesting any of this information, it is likely that you have received an attempted theft of your identity commonly called “phishing.” Likewise, if you receive an email urging you to log in to your account, and providing you with a link to the login page, it is also likely that you have received a “phishing” email. In either case, you should bring the email to our attention by forwarding the email to (email address, physical address, and/or telephone number).

If we send you an email requesting that you log in to your account, we strongly recommend that you open your web browser and manually input the address for our website. Doing so will ensure that you do not open some third-party website disguised to look like our website.

For more information about “phishing,” you should visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="https://www.ftc.gov" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov</a>

**How do we use the Personal Information we collect:**

Our goals in collecting Personal Information from you include: (i) providing you with information about the community such as: phase releases, pricing, amenities, upgrades and enhancements, community events and other information we deem you may find of interest; (ii) supporting business purposes, and community planning endeavors, that we believe are reasonable and consistent with fair business practices; (iii) notifying you if you are a winner of a contest, or to provide any information regarding any promotion or incentive program, that you have participated in; and (iv) contacting you concerning phased releases, amenities, upgrades, enhancements, community events or activities, services and products for new homes in the community that might be of interest to you. We also use your Personal Information to determine other information that will be delivered to you that may be targeted to your interests, as well as determining what periodic marketing, promotional and other notices to provide to you. You may, at any time, choose to not receive communications from us by “opting out” of specific mailing lists and services by sending an e-mail requesting removal to our Customer Service Department at: [info@lakewoodranch.com](mailto:info@lakewoodranch.com), or by writing us at the mailing address listed below.

We may disclose your Personal Information to homebuilders that build in our communities, to our affiliates (i.e., companies that we own, we are owned by, or we are under common ownership with), to consultants, and to other third parties with whom we have a business relationship. We may also disclose your Personal Information to third parties as we deem necessary or desirable to provide products and services that you have requested. Your Personal Information may also be disclosed to third parties on an aggregate basis and in a manner that does not reveal the personal identity of you or your business.
