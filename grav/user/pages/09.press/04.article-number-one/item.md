LAKEWOOD RANCH -- Apartment living is all the rage in Lakewood Ranch if the recent construction of multifamily housing in the master-planned community is any indication. 

Davis Development Inc. of Stockbridge, Ga., developers of the new Venue at Lakewood Ranch apartments across from Main Street, have submitted final site plans to Manatee County for construction of another 280-unit apartment complex on Silver Palm Boulevard off State Road 70 just west of Lorraine Road. 

The project, named Lakewood Davis Apartments at Lakewood Ranch, is managed locally by Stantec Consulting Services in Sarasota, and will be built under Davis subsidiary DD Sarasota II Inc. 

Gene Babb, land acquisitions spokesman for Davis Development, said the Lakewood Ranch apartment market is ideal. 

"We like Sarasota and Lakewood Ranch, in particular," Babb said. "It's always a good sign when a developer comes back for a second slice of the apple." 

Babb would not reveal the cost of the project. 

He said the company is hoping to begin construction as quickly as possible so the community might be available for occupancy next year. 

"We're still going through the permitting process so there is no firm date yet for the start of construction," Babb said. 

Manatee County Building and Development Services has received final site and construction plans and a fire flow design report from the company, as well as plans and permit requests submitted to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for stormwater pollution prevention, and erosion and sediment control. 

Davis Development will be responsible for paving around the property as well as utility and stormwater infrastructure. 

According to papers filed by Stantec Consulting, no lead construction company or sub-contracting companies have been hired yet. 

Situated on 23.98 acres, the Lakewood Davis apartments will be a mixture of two- and three-story buildings with individual garage access. Plans also call for a community clubhouse and pool. 

"We welcome all competitors. We're all in the same business doing the same thing and there's plenty to go around," said Francis Rivera, community manager for the Creekside Apartments, which opened a month before the Venue on Lakewood Ranch Boulevard just south of State Road 70. 

"There's not a lot of new construction in Bradenton and Sarasota and a lot of folks in the older communities want something new. In addition to this, they want to leave the hustle and bustle of the University Park area, where the older communities are and get away from the craziness of the new mall opening there soon," Rivera said. 

She also said the Creekside Apartments welcome out-of-state employees hired at the new mall who prefer to live in an apartment community to get to know the area before purchasing a home.
